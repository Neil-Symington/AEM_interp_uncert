A repository with a workflow for taking interpeted AEM horizons from Petrel, attaching interpretation metadata, compressing the data and estimating the interpretational uncertainty. This workflow is designed to capture interpretation uncertainty on point data before they are added into Geosciecnce Australia's Estimates of Geological and Geophysical Surfaces (EGGs) database. At the time of publishing this workflow the schema for this database is not yet finalised and the fields that are populated by this workflow are liable to change in the future to make the outputs EGGs compliant.

This workflow is not really designed to be easily implemented by others as it has a very specific purpose and has a number of dependencies. More detail on the workflow can be found in the wiki.
